# Introduction of the project
##### This project is about Tokimon!!! A Tokimon is a special creature living in Korea. Tokimons have different shapes and sizes. Also, they have special abilities including fly, fight, fire, spray water, electrify and freeze others. We use integer from 0 to 100 to measure their ability. Tokimon trainers are a special group of people who can control and train their Tokimons. Their main job is to catch Tokimons and train them properly in order to increase their abilities. In this project, we are going to write an application to keep track of the Tokimons and their trainers.

##### Database: A database migration is created to collect information about a series of Tokimons. The attributes for the Tokimon are name, weight, height, fly, fight, fire, water, electric, frozen (or ice), and total (the sum of their abilities). Another database migration is created to collect information about trainers. The attributes for trainers are name and level (depended on the number of Tokimons collected â€“ every three Tokimons gets a level up). Trainers can have more than one Tokimons but a Tokimon can only belong to one trainer.


# Features:

- Fly,Fight,Fire,Water,Electric,Ice : The ability of the Tokimons, with an integer between 0 and 100
- Total: The sum of the abilities of the Tokimon

## 3.Bar chart
- For displaying the data clearly, I add a bar chart for the trainer's level and add a bar chart for all tokimons' total abilities

## 4.Message prompt
- When you create, edit, or delete a trainer or a Tokimon, a message will pop up.
- If the value of the ability is out of the range (0,100), an error message will pop up.
